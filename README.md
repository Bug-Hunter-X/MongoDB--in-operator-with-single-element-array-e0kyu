# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element Array

This example demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with single-element arrays.  Incorrect usage can lead to unexpected query behavior. The solution provides the correct approach to handling this scenario.

## Bug
The `$in` operator is typically used to check if a field's value exists within a specified array.  However, a single-element array might not work as expected if the field in the database doesn't exactly match the array structure provided in the query.

## Solution
Instead of using an array for a single value, use a direct comparison operator to check for equality. This approach avoids the ambiguity associated with single-element arrays in `$in` queries.
